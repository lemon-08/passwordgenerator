# passwordgenerator
Our project help to generate strong password and can also download it in txt file.The pool of available characters includes 26 uppercase letters, 26 lowercase letters, and 10 digits. It also includes a collection of special characters that may vary from product to product. For simplicity, let's say there are 18 special characters available. That makes a nice round total of 80 characters to choose from. In a totally random password, there are 80 possibilities for every character. If you choose an eight-character password, the number of possibilities is 80 to the eighth power, or 1,677,721,600,000,000â€”more than a quadrillion. That's tough slogging for a brute-force cracking attack, and brute-force guessing is really the only way to crack a truly random password.
